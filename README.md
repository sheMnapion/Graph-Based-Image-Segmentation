# Graph-Based-Image-Segmentation
An implementation of 2004 paper on efficient graph-based image segmentation; wrote in python
# Running
To run the code, you need to make sure you have a python2.x environment as well as support for cv2, numpy and matplotlib <br>
At terminal, input "python graphBasedSegmentation.py" to run.
